        <p>A bright pop art painting on a 90 x 120 rectangular canvas using acrylic paint. The painting includes a mix of colors with black outline.
        </p>

    <p>Longer Image description: The top of the canvas features a slightly darker shade of blue, lighter than navy. The artist mentions that the clouds were not painted with a brush like the other shapes, but rather by dabbing paint onto the canvas with his hands. The clouds are of random shapes and sizes with no outline, making them appear to float. In the left corner of the canvas, there is a small sun, a yellow circle outlined with thick black paint. The painting also includes large mountains in various colors. On the left side of the canvas, a green mountain with finger stamps peeks through the frame. Below it is a yellow mountain, and below that, a brown mountain that barely appears on the canvas. The largest mountain is red and situated in the center, blocking the view of the other mountains. On the right side, a gray mountain with finger stamps is visible at the top, and an orange mountain is partially showing.

    This painting is straightforward, making it easy to identify what each shape represents. The black outlines on the mountains and the sun give it a cartoonish appearance. According to the artist, these mountains represent those from his homeland, Iraq, that still linger in his memories. The artist describes himself as a good person. This painting has a bright mood, full of color and happiness. The painting is peaceful and nostalgic, it brings you back to home, comfort, and childhood. It's quiet and plain but has a nuanced meaning behind it.</p>

In the photo, Jafar is wearing a red shirt, he has a trimmed beard, he is wearing rectangular transparent eye-glassess with black borders.
